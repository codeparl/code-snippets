# Tools Required to Run Java Code Snippets

To compile and run the Java code snippets in this repository, you need the Java Development Kit (JDK).

## Download and Install JDK

1. Download the latest [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) suitable for your operating system.

2. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

3. Add the JDK `bin` directory to your system `PATH` environment variable. This allows you to use `javac` and `java` from any terminal.

## Verifying Installation

```sh
java -version
javac -version
```

You should see the version information for both Java and the Java compiler.
